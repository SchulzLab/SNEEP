Table \@ref(tab:associatedREMs) lists the interactions that overlap with at least 2 SNPs, which significantly influence the binding affinity of TFs.
The second column provides the length of a REM, because the longer an interaction the higher the chance that several SNPs are overlapping.


For example the interaction  `r  REMs_table$regionID[[1]]` of length `r REMs_table$length[[1]]`, which is associated to the gene `r REMs_table$gene[[1]]` overlaps with `r REMs_table$frequence[[1]]` (not necessarily unique) SNPs.
Similar as for the previous table, column *TFs* and *SNPs* help to differentiate if the same SNP has an impact on several TFs or the same TF is affected by multiple SNPs.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
	REMs_table$TFs = gsub("..", "::", REMs_table$TFs, fixed=TRUE )
	REMs_table$TFs = gsub(".M", "(M", REMs_table$TFs, fixed=TRUE )
	REMs_table$TFs = gsub(".,", "),", REMs_table$TFs, fixed=TRUE )
	REMs_table$TFs = linebreak(REMs_table$TFs) 
	REMs_table$SNPs = linebreak(REMs_table$SNPs)
	REMs_table$gene = gsub("_", "\\_", REMs_table$gene, fixed=TRUE) #necessary since escape  must be false for linebreaking and the gene names can include _ which must be especially handled in latex (usually escape is taking care of this)

        knitr::kable(x = REMs_table, format = "latex",longtable = T, booktabs = T, col.names = c( "interaction ID", "length", "gene", "ensembl ID", "number different SNPs", "SNPs", "TFs"), align = "lllllll", linesep = "", caption = "interactions overlapping at least 2 SNPs with a significant change in the binding affinity of a TF.",  row.names = F, escape = F, label = "associatedREMs") %>%
