Table \@ref(tab:associatedREMs) lists the interactions that overlap with SNPs, which significantly influence the binding affinity of TFs.
The second column provides the length of a REM, because the longer an interaction  the higher the chance that several SNPs are overlapping.


For example the interaction  `r  allREMs$regionID[[1]]` of length `r allREMs$length[[1]]`, which is associated to the gene `r allREMs$gene[[1]]` overlaps with `r allREMs$frequence[[1]]` (not necessarily unique) SNPs.
Similar as for the previous table, column *TFs* and *SNPs* help to differentiate if the same SNP has an impact on several TFs or the same TF is affected by multiple SNPs.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
	allREMs$TFs = gsub("..", "::", allREMs$TFs, fixed=TRUE )
	allREMs$TFs = gsub(".var.2.", "(var.2)", allREMs$TFs, fixed=TRUE )
	allREMs$TFs = gsub(".var.3.", "(var.3)", allREMs$TFs, fixed=TRUE )
	allREMs$TFs = linebreak(allREMs$TFs) 
	allREMs$SNPs = linebreak(allREMs$SNPs)
	allREMs$gene = gsub("_", "\\_", allREMs$gene, fixed=TRUE) #necessary since escape  must be false for linebreaking and the gene names can include _ which must be especially handled in latex (usually escape is taking care of this)

        knitr::kable(x = allREMs, format = "latex",longtable = T, booktabs = T, col.names = c( "interaction ID", "length", "gene", "ensembl ID", "TFs", "SNPs", "frequency"), align = "llllllc", linesep = "", caption = "interactions overlapping SNPs with a significant change in the binding affinity of a TF.",  row.names = F, escape = F, label = "associatedREMs") %>%
