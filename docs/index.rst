SNEEP is fast method to identify regulatory non-coding SNPs (rSNPs) that modify the binding sites of Transcription Factors (TFs) for large collections of SNPs provided by the user. SNEEP combines our statistical approach introduced in our preprint is 'A statistical approach to identify regulatory DNA variants' (TODO: add link) with epigenetic data and additional functionalities. 

A summary of the functionalities is shown below:
