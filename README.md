# SNEEP: SNP exploration and functional analysis using epigenetic data

SNEEP is fast method to identify regulatry SNPs (rSNPs) that modify the binding sites of Transcription Factors (TFs) for large collections of SNPs provided by the user. 

The full documentation is available on [Read the Docs](https://sneep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

We used our statistical approach to determine non-coding disease genes in cardiovascular diseasee. For more details see:

We a currently working on a paper that introduce our SNEEP pipeline in more detail.

## TODOs: 
- test conda application
- include RMarkdown to bioconda package
